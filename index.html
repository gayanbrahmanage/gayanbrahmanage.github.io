      <description>I lead the development of select video analytics projects, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques to deliver solutions tailored to customer-specific requirements, timelines, and deliverable. My role encompasses the design and implementation of real-time software systems, ensuring that solutions are optimized for hardware constraints, performance, and robustness. For the projects under my leadership, I manage the full development lifecycle, from research and development to deployment, ensuring that each solution aligns with both the customerâ€™s objectives and technical specifications while driving continuous improvement in efficiency, functionality, and reliability.

      -Predictive 3D Collision Avoidance System for Canada Robot Arm on ISS- Led the development of a predictive 3D collision avoidance system for the Canada Robot Arm on the International Space Station (ISS). My primary responsibility was developing a metric-scale depth prediction model from single images, utilizing existing ISS cameras to achieve precise 3D clearance volume estimation for robotic arm operations, complemented by EKF-based object tracking capabilities. Additionally, I designed and implemented real-time software integrating the depth prediction model, object detection, 3D tracking modules, and a 3D GUI.

      To meet the stringent requirements set by the Canadian Space Agency, the depth prediction model was optimized for real-time performance on space edge devices, achieving 5 FPS. This optimization involved reducing model precision from 32-bit to 16-bit floating point (FP16) using TensorRT, applying structured pruning to minimize computational complexity, and leveraging CUDA and TensorRT for hardware-specific acceleration. The model was exported to a lightweight ONNX format for efficient deployment and faster inference. Model distillation further enhanced efficiency by training a compact student model that retained the accuracy of a larger 110M parameter teacher model. These advancements ensured resource-efficient, high-accuracy operation, enabling safe and effective robotic arm maneuvers in space.

      Software Tool for Ship Tracking Using WorldView-3 and AIS Data - I involved in a development of a software tool for real-time ship tracking by integrating WorldView-3 satellite imagery with AIS data. The system utilized Mask R-CNN for ship detection in satellite images, and the AIS tracking information was fused with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate smooth and continuous ship trajectories over extended periods. The project addressed several key challenges, including the discontinuities in AIS data, high levels of noise, and varying sampling rates, by implementing robust data fusion and filtering techniques. The tool significantly improved the accuracy of ship tracking and trajectory prediction, ensuring reliable maritime monitoring despite inconsistencies in AIS data.

      <description>A project was undertaken to create an autonomous driving dataset as a part of my Ph.D. research work. A custom-developed wide-baseline stereo camera system was devised for this purpose. The sensor was mounted on a car and gathered stereo data in diverse driving scenarios. An IMU and GPS-based sensor system were integrated to obtain ground-truth motion tracking. Additionally, real-time software was developed to record synchronous stereo frames and ground-truth data at 16 frames per second.</description>

      <description>Robot autonomous navigation software, building on my Masterâ€™s thesis research in 2D SLAM, path planning, and target tracking, was executed in two phases. I first transitioned the robotâ€™s software from a Windows-based system to the Robot Operating System (ROS) using ROS-Kinetic, adapting the existing sensor acquisition code for integration. In the second phase, I developed control software to handle sensor data, perform target detection, execute path planning, and manage trajectory navigation. Additionally, I integrated a laser scanner and an RGB-D camera into the robot, ensuring their functionality within the ROS-based environment.</description>
