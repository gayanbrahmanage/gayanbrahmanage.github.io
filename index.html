            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p><strong>Since 2022:</strong> Research Assistant, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. The <strong>development of a humanoid robot</strong> for the City of Calgary is currently underway. I am serving as the lead developer and designer of the robot hardware and software. My primary responsibilities encompass the complete mechanical and electronics design, assembly, and development of controller software. The overarching objective of this project is to design an interactive robot capable of greeting and assisting visitors to the City of Calgary premises. Ongoing collaboration with various teams at the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary aims to integrate hardware and software with natural language processing capabilities to deliver an interactive experience for the public <a href="https://github.com/gayanbrahmanage/kella-v1.0" target="_blank">Project page</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>2021-2023:</strong> Graduate Research Assistant, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. Developed a Python-TensorFlow implementation for <strong>monocular depth prediction</strong>, integrating PhD research findings on single-image depth estimation. This implementation introduces the Dual Convolution Vision Transformer (DCViT) for metric-scale depth prediction using unsupervised learning techniques. The project highlights advanced methodologies in depth estimation, leveraging unsupervised learning to achieve accurate metric-scale depth from single images, and builds upon extensive research conducted during my PhD, advancing the field of depth prediction technology <a href="https://github.com/gayanbrahmanage/i3D-iMAGE-FORMER" target="_blank">Project page</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>2018-2023:</strong> Graduate Research Assistant, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. Developed <strong>a real-time 3D-SLAM software package</strong> using C++ and GTK for Linux environments, integrating advanced findings from my PhD research with current literature. The software features a multi-threaded architecture with dedicated threads for depth prediction, local mapping, sparse bundle adjustment, and loop closing, operating alongside main threads for GUI visualization. It employs a parallel processing structure for loop processing, including key-point detection, matching, and motion estimation using RANSAC and EM. The system dynamically adjusts thread allocation based on computational resources, aiming for high-performance SLAM solutions in real-time environments <a href="https://github.com/gayanbrahmanage/3d-slam" target="_blank">Project page</a>.</p>
