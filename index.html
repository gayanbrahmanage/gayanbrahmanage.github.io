                    <h3>Computer Vision Developer</h3>
                    <p class="sub-title">Complex System Inc., Calgary, AB, Canada</p>
                    <p> I lead the development of select video analytics projects, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques to deliver solutions tailored to customer-specific requirements, timelines, and deliverables. My role encompasses the design and implementation of real-time software systems, ensuring that solutions are optimized for hardware constraints, performance, and robustness. For the projects under my leadership, I manage the full development lifecycle, from research and development to deployment, ensuring that each solution aligns with both the customer’s objectives and technical specifications while driving continuous improvement in efficiency, functionality, and reliability. </p>
                    <p> Predictive 3D Collision Avoidance System for Canada Robot Arm on ISS- Led the development of a predictive 3D collision avoidance system for the Canada Robot Arm on the International Space Station (ISS). My primary responsibility was creating a metric-scale depth prediction model from single images, leveraging existing ISS cameras to ensure accurate 3D clearance volume estimation for robotic arm operations. Additionally, I designed and implemented real-time software integrating the depth prediction model, object detection, 3D tracking modules, and a 3D GUI. To meet the stringent requirements set by the Canadian Space Agency, the depth prediction model was optimized for real-time performance on space edge devices, achieving 5 FPS. This optimization involved reducing model precision from 32-bit to 16-bit floating point (FP16) using TensorRT, applying structured pruning to minimize computational complexity, and leveraging CUDA and TensorRT for hardware-specific acceleration. The model was exported to a lightweight ONNX format for efficient deployment and faster inference. Model distillation further enhanced efficiency by training a compact student model that retained the accuracy of a larger 110M parameter teacher model. These advancements ensured resource-efficient, high-accuracy operation, enabling safe and effective robotic arm maneuvers in space. </p>
                    <p> Software Tool for Ship Tracking Using WorldView-3 and AIS Data - I was involved in the development of a software tool for real-time ship tracking by integrating WorldView-3 satellite imagery with AIS data. The system utilized Mask R-CNN for ship detection in satellite images, and the AIS tracking information was fused with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate smooth and continuous ship trajectories over extended periods. The project addressed several key challenges, including the discontinuities in AIS data, high levels of noise, and varying sampling rates, by implementing robust data fusion and filtering techniques. The tool significantly improved the accuracy of ship tracking and trajectory prediction, ensuring reliable maritime monitoring despite inconsistencies in AIS data.</p>

In the second phase, I developed control software to handle sensor data, perform target detection, execute path planning, and manage trajectory navigation. Additionally, I integrated a laser scanner and an RGB-D camera into the robot, ensuring their functionality within the ROS-based environment. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNcI8IKpin0" style="color: blue;">(Video link)</a></p>

                    <h3>Wireless Display System Design for Performance Measurement</h3>
                    <h4>University of Moratuwa</h4>

                    <p>At MAS Holdings Casualine Factory in Sri Lanka, I designed and developed a wireless display system to monitor and optimize the production line performance. This system was created to improve real-time monitoring and management of garment production processes by providing accurate data on operator efficiency and identifying bottlenecks in the line.</p>
                    <p>I was primarily responsible for the electronics design and embedded programming of the system. The wireless display system consists of a master node that displays data acquired from hundreds of input nodes located at various points along the garment production line. Each input node captures trigger inputs from machine operators and transmits this data wirelessly via an RF network to the master node.</p>
                    <p>The master node processes these inputs to estimate the task time for each operation by calculating the time intervals between triggers from each operator. Each input node is assigned a specific ID to uniquely identify operators, allowing the master node to track individual performance and provide detailed historical data. This information enables line supervisors to monitor task times for each operator, quickly identify performance issues, and address bottlenecks in the production line.</p>
                    <p>This project allowed me to leverage my expertise in electronics design, embedded programming, and wireless communication systems to develop a robust solution that enhances operational efficiency and productivity in a challenging manufacturing environment.</p>

                    <p>As part of a project for Melwa, a leading steel and concrete wire manufacturing company, I was responsible for designing a prototype of a wireless data monitoring system to enhance communication along the production line. The manufacturing environment at Melwa presented significant challenges due to high levels of dust and noise, which made traditional wired and verbal communication methods unreliable and ineffective.</p>
                    <p>To address this issue, our team proposed a code-based communication method where specific numerical codes were used to represent the status of each stage of the production line. My role involved designing the wireless system that would allow machine operators to manually enter these codes, which would then be transmitted to the appropriate nodes across the production line using a local RF network.</p>
                    <p>This system enabled efficient, real-time communication of critical information between operators, ensuring smooth operation and coordination despite the challenging industrial environment. My work included developing the RF network for robust wireless communication, designing user-friendly interfaces for code entry and display, and ensuring reliable transmission and reception of data under adverse conditions.</p>
