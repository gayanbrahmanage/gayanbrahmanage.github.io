                        <h3>Reverse Engineering and Design of Super-Heated Extraction System</h3>
                        <h4>University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h4>
                        <p><strong>Sep 2014 - Oct 2014</strong></p>
                        <p>I led the design and implementation of a super-heated extraction system as part of a reverse engineering project involving an HPLC pump for the Faculty of Applied Science at the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. This project was developed to support academic research conducted by the Faculty of Applied Science.</p>
                        <p>My responsibilities included re-engineering the HPLC pump to enhance its performance for super-heated extraction processes. This involved redesigning key components, integrating advanced technologies, and ensuring that the system met the precise requirements of the research. I managed both the mechanical and electronic aspects of the redesign and coordinated with the faculty to align the system with their research objectives.</p>
                        <p>The successful implementation of this system facilitated more effective and efficient extraction processes, contributing to the advancement of the academic research conducted at the university.</p>

                        <h3>Skoog Music Instrument - R&D</h3>
                        <h4>Power Migration Partners UK Ltd</h4>
                        <p><strong>Jan 2014 - Mar 2014</strong></p>
                        <p>Under the supervision of Power Migration Partners Ltd. in the United Kingdom, I conducted research and development on a joystick for the Skoog Music instrument. This project focused on understanding and enhancing the performance of a foam joystick equipped with a 3-axis magnetic sensor.</p>
                        <p>My responsibilities included researching the output patterns of the magnetic sensors based on the pressure applied to the foam joystick. I analyzed the noise patterns and identified distinct patterns for both individual sensors and combinations of sensors under varying conditions. I applied advanced filtering techniques to refine sensor data and developed an algorithm to accurately estimate the point of pressure application on the joystick.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this, I created a multivariate Gaussian model in n-dimensional space to calculate the likelihood of template-to-measurement matching, based on consistent patterns observed during the calibration stage. This model significantly improved the joystick's accuracy and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience of the Skoog Music instrument.</p>
                        <p>This project allowed me to apply my expertise in sensor data analysis, algorithm development, and signal processing, contributing to innovative advancements in musical technology.</p>

                        <h3>Performance Improvement of a Controller Board for Inverters in Hybrid Energy Systems</h3>
                        <h4>Power Migration Partners UK Ltd</h4>
                        <p><strong>Jun 2013 - Sep 2013</strong></p>
                        <p>I participated in a project focused on enhancing the performance of a controller board for inverters used in hybrid energy systems. My primary responsibility was the embedded programming of the controller board using the F28M35M52C microcontroller.</p>
                        <p>My tasks included input and output mapping, testing, and calibrating to align with the specifications of the existing board. I developed firmware based on the provided requirements and tested it across various input settings to ensure optimal performance. This involved extensive testing for long-duration operations and identifying all possible states, including potential unknown states.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I conducted detailed analysis and experiments based on the given testing procedures to identify areas for improvement and ensure the reliability and efficiency of the controller board in real-world applications. This project allowed me to leverage my expertise in embedded programming and system optimization to enhance hybrid energy solutions.</p>
