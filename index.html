            <h3>Humanoid Robot Development for the City of Calgary</h3>
            <p>University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada (Since 2022)</p>
            <p>The <strong>development of a humanoid robot</strong> for the City of Calgary is currently underway. I am serving as the lead developer and designer of the robot hardware and software. My primary responsibilities encompass the complete mechanical and electronics design, assembly, and development of controller software. The overarching objective of this project is to design an interactive robot capable of greeting and assisting visitors to the City of Calgary premises. Ongoing collaboration with various teams at the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary aims to integrate hardware and software with natural language processing capabilities to deliver an interactive experience for the public <a href="https://github.com/gayanbrahmanage/kella-v1.0" target="_blank">Project page</a>.</p>
