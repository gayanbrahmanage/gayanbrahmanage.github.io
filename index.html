                <h3>Development of a Humanoid Robot</h3>
                <p><strong>Since 2022:</strong> University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. The development of a humanoid robot for the City of Calgary is currently underway. I am serving as the lead developer and designer of the robot hardware and software. The project involves integrating a custom stereo camera setup, real-time software for data synchronization, and a comprehensive interactive system for engaging visitors at city premises. The robot is designed to enhance visitor experiences and support various municipal services through interactive capabilities and automated tasks.</p>

                <p><strong>2024:</strong> The project aims to create a robot for the City of Calgary that will act as an interactive receptionist. Key features include autonomous movement, verbal interactions, real-time video surveillance, and self-maintenance. The robot will integrate advanced computer vision and natural language processing technologies to provide engaging and efficient public service experiences.</p>

                <h3>Real-Time 3D-SLAM Package Development</h3>
                <p><strong>2024:</strong> Developing a real-time 3D-SLAM package using C++ and GTK for Linux environments. The package processes images at 8 frames per second and includes a multi-threaded design with separate threads for depth prediction, local mapping, sparse bundle adjustment, and loop closing. It features a parallel loop processing structure with key-point detection, matching, and motion estimation using RANSAC and EM. The system dynamically allocates threads based on computational resources and integrates findings from my PhD research with existing literature.</p>

                <p><strong>2024:</strong> Developing a monocular depth prediction system using Python and TensorFlow, which incorporates research findings from my PhD. The implementation features a Dual Convolution Vision Transformer (DCViT) for predicting depth from a single image using unsupervised learning methods. The primary objective of this project is to advance depth prediction accuracy and applicability in various fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality.</p>

                <h3>Edge-AI Experimental Platform</h3>
                <p><strong>2023:</strong> Designed and developed an experimental Edge-AI platform consisting of a hexacopter drone equipped with edge-AI processing hardware and multiple cameras, including RGB and monochrome, and a radar system. This platform supports ongoing research activities and experiments by providing a versatile and high-performance platform for testing advanced AI algorithms in real-time scenarios.</p>

                <h3>GUI-Based Drone Control Tool</h3>
                <p><strong>2024:</strong> Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) software tool to control an off-the-shelf mini drone for lab experiments.
